I'll admit it, I'm a newbie who thought Java was what people called it when they were to lazy to add the script. 
(Hahaha noob thought Java and Javascript were the same language XD) So....with that said, you can guess my competence in this language. I have used Java and C++  in other classes, so that helps a bit. But I think the problem with experience with other languages is that Javascript seems to behave differently. This could be me just being overwhelmed as a beginner, but C++ and Java had sort of a pattern, almost like a template you followed to write your code. Javascript seems to let you do whatever you want, for instance, the permissions and properties work differently. In one of our WODs we were shown that we can directly call properties from one method to another. This opinion will probably change as I get used to this language, but it seems a bit daunting at the moment.

Javascript with all it's strangeness and problems that it's caused me is still an interesting language. Each leason and WOD so far has helped to show off what Javascript can do. It's hard, but I'm enjoying the challenge so to say. Although, the one gigantic dead rotting moose in the middle of the road for me has been JSfiddle. I'm actually not sure if it's JSfiddle or Google Chrome. I would get random errors from code that originally worked, spend about an hour troubleshooting (renaming variables, rewritting the code...etc) just trying to figure out what went wrong. I then had the idea to reopen JSfiddle on another browser and copy pasted the code onto a new fiddle. It strangely worked. I have been using JSfiddle on the new browser without any isssues so far. Another small gripe I have with JSfiddle is that I wish the error messages were a bit more helpful.

In class a few days ago, our professor talked about how a lot of people consider Javascript a bad programming language. I feel it's still to early for me to make my mind up on this subject. But I feel this is sort of a pointless argument. I feel no language is inherently horrible, just as I dont think there is any perfect language. Much like spoken language, there are things certain languages do better then others, while there are also things that they lack as well. An example that comes to mind is a characteristic of the Chinese language. From what I understand, they seem to have a unique title for each family member depending on if you are on the mother's or father's side of the family. Everyone is either cousin, uncle or aunty in english, yet we still manage to get by. It's just a matter of understanding that shortcoming and finding creative ways around it. I feel like this is a problem that everyone will expereience regardless of the language they choose. But....then again I was the guy that thought Java was the same as Javascript. Maybe I missed somehting along the road.
