summary: Helped write a program to use a controler to control the size and speed of a light pattern as it moves about a x-y axis plane. Also added in edge detection.

Project details:
Light from a projector is channeled mirrors and a focusing lense to project a light pattern onto a glass slides containing silicon oil. The heat created from the focused light on the bottom glass slide something akin to an ocean current, moving from a heated area to that of a cooled one. The result is that by controling the light and heating the bottom of the glass slide, we could essentially control the micro bubbles that naturally occur in the silicone oil.
