Graphene is a material that is made from a single layer of carbon atoms. It is flexible but has a tensile strength high than steel. The most notable property is of Graphene is that it has high electrical conductivity. 
A battery is made up of a cathode (+), an anode (-) and an electrolyte solution to allow ion migration between the two. 
We decided to use Galinstan as the anode, Graphene as the cathode and Sodium Hydroxide as the solution. We were in the end able to create a charge, just not a substantial one. The problem with this was that there was speculation that the Graphene was not reacting with the Galinstan, but with the air.
